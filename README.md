# Project Motivation

It is a well-documented fact that to improve at a skill, you need constant feedback. When learning to cook, you have others taste it and be honest. When learning an instrument, you record yourself to see how you sound. The same is true for teaching, although getting consistent feedback is a tall order. 

Under the CU Boulder CS Department's current system for managing Teaching Assistants (TAs), we have students fill out questionaires twice a semester, which helps the department make hiring decisions for subsequent semesters. However, this limited amount of feedback does not greatly help our current TAs improve in their roles as educators. Instead, from a TAs perspective, it gives a glimpse at the issues we face in teaching our students but fails to provide enough feedback to help us learn from our mistakes and experiment with our methodology.

To aid in solving this problem, we are developing a system to help TAs get regular feedback from their students. Using our app, a TA can sign into their educator dashboard and send a brief anonymous survey to their students. The survey should take no longer than one minute to complete, and be in a simple Google form. By doing this, and stressing the ease and minimal amount of time it takes to complete, our experiments have shown that a TA can get a majority response rate at regular intervals throughout the semester. These surveys will contain questions that the TA themselves want the answers to, which allows them to gauge understanding of core materials in their class and get constructive feedback. 

Upon the completion of a survey, the data will be automatically imported into the educator dashboard, which will provide a brief analysis of the results. Using simple questions on students' comprehension of core topics, we can get a quantitative look at how much our students understand. Using Natural Language Processing, we can classify the ratio of positive to negative comments, as well as identify suggestions within these comment blocks that may be of use to the TA. The raw, anonymized data will also be available for the TAs to view.

By seeing these results at regular intervals throughout the semester, our department's TAs can continually grow their skills as educators. With unofficial feedback at regular intervals, we can better gauge how our students respond to TAs lectures, and ensure that students are comfortable with the material taught. If they are not, this will be reflected in the survey results, which will give the TA actionable feedback on what the students simply are not understanding and encourage the TA to experiment with different methods. This process, completed regularly throughout the semester, will likely improve the comprehension of our students, thus improving the quality of our department's undergraduate education.
